# 2021-Complexity-Jam
This is the home for our submission to the 2021 Complexity Jam

## How to Play
Your goal is to survive from 8AM to 2PM. The stress mechanic is currently unimplemented so there is no way to loose. When implemented, you will have to complete math problems in the "Math" tab to survive. You can still complete math problems by entering answers in on the keypad. The keypad can either be controlled by keyboard inputs or by the on-screen keypad. To answer, press the submit button (E).
### Controls
Button | Function
--- | --- 
Move mouse to the bottom of the screen | Flip monitor down
`0`-`9`* | Input numbers on the keypad
`C` or `.`* | Clear keypad input
`E` or `Enter`*| Submit keypad input

*These inputs can also be controlled by the on-screen keypad
