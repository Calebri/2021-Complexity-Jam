## How to Play
Your goal is to survive from 8AM to 2PM. You have a health bar. If there are math questions that are unanswered, you will start loosing health. You can complete math problems by entering answers in on the keypad. The keypad can either be controlled by keyboard inputs or by the on-screen keypad. To answer, press the submit button (E).
